I'll be happy when this
lonely city feels like mine
Maybe when I have a license
and a car to drive
I can take a trip to nowhere
on the 405
Just to feel alive
I'll be happy when I finally
can find real friends
Who all like me as I am and
they don't all pretend
That I'm more than
just a temporary means to
an end
Thinkin' maybe then that I'll
be fine
But what if it's all too late?
What if I'm bound to break?
'Cause what if there's
nowhere to escape?
Once the high starts to fade,
fade
I start to fade, fade,
I start to fade
I'll be happy when my
smiles aren't in self-defense
When I finally belong
outside convenience
And they ask me how I'm
doing and they really care
for real
I fear, I fear,
I fear that life's not mine
And it's all too late
What if I'm bound to break?
'Cause what if there's
nowhere to escape?
Once the high starts to fade,
fade
I start to fade, fade,
don't wanna fade, fade
I start to fade, fade,
don't wanna fade
I'll be a buzzkill forever
Be a buzzkill forever
Be a buzzkill forever
Be a buzzkill forever
Be a buzzkill forever
Be a buzzkill forever
Be a buzzkill forever
Be a buzzkill forever
