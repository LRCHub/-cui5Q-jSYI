Don't ask me what's in my head, don't pretend like you give a shit.
Don't ask me why I look so sad, cause ill be happy when your fucking dead.
Who the hell do you think you fool? can these games fucking end?
And what the hell do you think you gain, pretending that we're friends?
I haven't figured out your fucking cause, but its not genuine.
And when the truth comes out in the end, I think ill cut off your head.
And ill be fucking happy, when your fucking dead, and I'll fucking smile, when your fucking dead.
